Here is a proof of concept exploit tool for Pimeyes Facial Recognition Search. After contacting Pimeyes and receiving no response, I've decided to publish this tool. 
It allows for the user to receive full search results, namely web links, from Pimeyes searches. 

Use:
1. Clone the directory "git clone https://github.com/addycb/Pimeyes-Free-POC"
2. Navigate into the directory "cd Pimeyes-Free-POC"
3. Run the tool :: "python main.py"
4. Following prompt, input path to face image on local machine. 

Result: You will receive a collection of unobfuscated results, namely links to where that face was found.
